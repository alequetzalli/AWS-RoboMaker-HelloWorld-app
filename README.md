# AWS RoboMaker: 'Hello World' app

The AWS RoboMaker teams are targeting to improve the way robot devs build robots: they want to do to robotics development what Linux did to Unix. 

* *Brief intro on ROS* (Robot Operating System) *& Gazebo* (simulator)
* *Build a robot application.* A robot application is a ROS-based application that runs on a physical robot. 
* *Launch an *AWS RoboMaker simulation*.* To run your application in a *AWS RoboMaker* simulation, you need to build & launch simulations to generate the 3D artificial world your robot will move in. You will also use Gazebo plugins to control the movement of a robot within that world. 
* *Deploy a robot application.* We will deploy a robot application to a TurtleBot3 robot. Deployment will be done over-the-air using AWS IoT Greengrass. 
* *Access logging and monitoring features. *
